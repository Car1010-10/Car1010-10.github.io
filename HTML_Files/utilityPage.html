    <p id="paragraph2">For the longest time I always knew I wanted to work on video games. I have had always day dreamed about doing what I'm doing right now 
      , so it's a dream come true that I'm able to work within this industry. 
      Despite my trials and tribulations with already working on several projects in the past, this has not greatly dampend my 
      passion for game development. Which for a good while I had spent cultivating little by little with each and passing 
      project I get my hands on. I would love to spread my vision and plethora of ideas to the whole world with my game development process. 
      I'am currently a game programmer, where I essentially program the game play elements within a game, which is quite self explanatory.
